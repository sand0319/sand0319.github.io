Hello this is the web porfolio of Christian Sandhu,

This web porfolio is going to used for future photography work, little of coding and eventually video "when I start making good quality videos".
The  most challenging thing in my portfolio to make were my nav and the scroll in my code page. The scroll eventually worked after lots of trial and error while my nav couldn't work no matter what I tried so I had to stick woth a basic nav instead of a hamburger menu like what I wanted.

The fonts used in this were the google fonts Bitter and Allerta, the assets were the twitter and facebook icons, while everything else was created by me.
